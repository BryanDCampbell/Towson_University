Fundamental data structures used in programming and the basic techniques used to design and analyze algorithms. 
Topics include: complexity analysis of elementary algorithms, linear data structures, trees, heaps, graphs, 
search algorithms (balanced binary trees, B-trees, hashing), sorting algorithms, 
basic graph algorithms (graph traversal, topological sorting, shortest path, minimum spanning trees), 
and paradigms in the design of algorithms (divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy).
